            When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you
            to achieve it. This is the basic principle of the Soul of the World.
            Itâ€™s the belief that if you pursue your dreams with passion, the
            entire universe will align to make them come true. But in doing so,
            you must also listen to your heart, trust in the signs, and be
            willing to face challenges and setbacks along the way.
